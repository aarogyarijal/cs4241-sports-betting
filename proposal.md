## Project Overview
We will be developing a sports betting application which enables end-to-end user experience of a betting platform. The app will allow users to create an account, log in, and manage a personal balance. From there, users can browse a list of upcoming games, select a team, and place a wager using their account funds. Once the game outcome is determined, the system will update the user’s balance to reflect wins or losses.  

The goal of this project is to simulate the core mechanics of a sports betting app without adding unnecessary complexity. We will not implement features like real-time odds, external payment processing, or live data feeds, as these go beyond the project’s timeline and scope. Instead, the focus is on demonstrating the essential functionality: authentication, account balance management, betting flow, and result tracking.

## Technologies
- **React** (frontend UI framework for building interactive betting screens)
- **Vite** (fast development/build tooling for the frontend)
- **Express** (backend framework for APIs handling login, balance updates, and bets)

This stack is lightweight, modern, and well-suited for us.

## Direction
The final prototype will include:
1. **User Authentication** – Users can sign up, log in, and have a personal account with a starting balance.  
2. **Betting Dashboard** – Users can view a list of games and choose a team to bet on.  
3. **Balance Tracking** – Bets will be deducted from the balance, and winnings will be credited back after results. 

By combining these features, the app will be a complete sports betting experience at a prototype scale. This approach ensures the project meets minimum expectations while still resembling a professional, end-to-end product.
